## CI/CD PIPELINE GENERATOR by DEVOPS ENGINEER


As a DevOps Engineer, your responsibilities also include managing CI/CD pipeline and services in that pipeline. These pipeline services are source control with AWS CodeCommit, build the code (compile, unit test, static code analysis, security code analysis etc.) with AWS CodeBuild, deploy to different environments (Test, Prod etc.) with AWS CodeDeploy, automating the test. 

Designing and configuring all these services in a pipeline with AWS CodePipeline is not adding value to the business, so it is better to automate the pipeline generation as well.

We will prepare an AWS CloudFormation Template, that will create all resources required for the CI/CD pipeline. In this AWS CloudFormation template, we will use NESTED templates that will help us to reuse the sub-templates, and design easier if any change required. CI/CD pipeline will be as the diagra below.
